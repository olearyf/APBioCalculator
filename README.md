# APBioCalculator
A program I made my sophomore year of high school at the end of the first semester of my first CS course. It includes functions to deal with the calculations needed within the AP Biology class I was taking at the time. It is written in Python.
It contains the following:
  Chi-Square Calculator
  Cylinder Volume Calculator
  Dilution Functions
  Final Grade Calculator
  Gibbs Free Energy Functions
  Hardy-Weinberg Functions
  Mean Calculator
  pH Calculator
  Pressure Potential Calculator
  Rectangular Prism Volume Calculator
  Solute Potential Calculator
  Solute Potential of Solution Calculator
  Sphere Surface Area Calculator
  Spher Volume Calculator
  Standard Deviation Calculator
  Standard Error Calculator
  Temperature Conversions
  Water Potential Calculator
